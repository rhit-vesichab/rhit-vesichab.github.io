                        <p>Hello, my name is Austin Vesich, and I am a highly motivated software engineer at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I prioritize iOS development, and love the feeling of figuring things out for the first time. As a result, I am currently focused on expanding my knowledge of swift and sharpening my existing skills to be the best possible.
                            When developing apps, I focus on what matters; I make sure every feature works the best it possibly can, all of the bugs are worked out, and every control speaks for itself and is easily accessible. I don't believe in releasing broken production code, and I work my hardest to prevent doing so.
                            As a result of my hard work and dedication, I have a number of both practice projects and completed applications available for view on my github and the <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio page</a>.
                            <br> 
                            <br>
                            In my free time, I enjoy competing in VEX Robotics, building Lego sets, and playing video games. In fact, I enjoy VEX Robotics so much that I am in the process of establishing a team at Rose-Hulman to compete in VEXU, the official university league for VEX.
                            As for Legos and video games, that's what I do when I'm not programming robots or bringing the world together with innovative iOS applications.
